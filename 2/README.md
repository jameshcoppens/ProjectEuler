EVEN FIBONACCI NUMBERS
-------------------

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the two previous terms.  By
starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89, .....

By considering the terms in the Fibionacci sequence whose values do not exceed four
million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Do this in java, python, and ruby.  Please make an estimation of the operational memory,
cpu performance, big theta, little theta, during your implementation make the stored data
structure for the Fibonacci sequence global within the program, make as many atomic
functions or classes for the main program to control access to this stored data structure.
