MULTIPLES OF 3 AND 5
-------------------

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5. We get 3, 5, 6,
and 9.  The sum of these multiples is 23.  Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5
below 1000.

Do this in java, python, and ruby.  Please make an estimation of the operational memory,
cpu performance, big theta, little theta, distribution of access across an operational
system that is implemented in multiple cloud regions and write out to a NOSQL data store
with the key to each natural number defined as the current time.
